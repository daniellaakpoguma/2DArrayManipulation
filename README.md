## Functions

This repository provides the following functions for manipulating 2D arrays:

- `void print_array(int** array, int rows, int columns)`: Prints all elements in the 2D array.
- `void sort_array(int** array, int rows, int columns)`: Sorts the 2D array in ascending order using a bubble sort algorithm.
- `void reverse_array(int** array, int rows, int columns)`: Reverses the order of rows in the 2D array.
- `void randomize_array(int** array, int rows, int columns)`: Randomizes the elements in the 2D array.

Feel free to explore the source code to see the implementation details of each function.
